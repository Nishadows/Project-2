# Project-2
Our group explored the effect of the technology sector on housing prices. With Crystal City being selected for Amazon’s HQ2 and our classes shared industry in the tech sector, this is a very relevant and timely topic. In researching this “Amazon Effect” we were very intrigued by the ramifications to us, both as citizens and professionals in the industry. 

We explored both the DMV and the Seattle Metro area as these are two of the most heavily impacted areas within the US and will soon have the shared honor of being a headquarter of Amazon.
